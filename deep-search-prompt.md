4. **Google**: "site:faire.com French fashion" or "site:ankorstore.com mode française"

## Priority Targets:
- Brands with strong Instagram presence (shows they're digitally savvy)
- Companies mentioning "wholesale" or "B2B" on their website
- Brands with professional product photography (indicates B2B readiness)
- Companies with clear "Retailers" or "Stockists" section on website

## Notes:
- Focus on finding the actual founder/CEO name, not generic contact
- Prefer companies that seem overwhelmed by multi-platform management
- Look for brands that launched 2-10 years ago (established but still growing)

Return exactly 30 companies meeting these criteria.
